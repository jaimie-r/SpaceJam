This database architecture includes the following models:

Team: Stores team information with a name field.
Player: Tracks player details, also using a name field.
Game: Represents individual games, with fields for date and references to home_team and away_team. 
Each team relationship is established via foreign keys.
GamePlayerStats: This model captures a player's statistics for a specific game. It includes fields 
for performance metrics like points, assists, and rebounds, and is linked to both the Player and 
Game models via foreign keys.
Shots: Stores data about individual shot attempts, including coordinates (location_x, location_y) 
and whether the shot was successful (is_made). Each shot is associated with a GamePlayerStats 
instance. The architecture emphasizes relational connections between teams, players, games, and 
player performance, ensuring efficient data querying and flexibility for game stats analysis.
